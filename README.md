# Follow Mastodon User Browser Extension

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This extension adds a button to the toolbar that will popup a window to follow
the Mastodon user on the current page. This is mostly to scratch an itch where
some mastodon pages make you have to copy the username, then search for it in
your own instance, then click follow there once the search loads.

To use a server other than mastodon.social, go to the settings page and enter
the server address including https://, omitting any trailing slash.
